                        <h5 class="justify-align">
                           <strong >This digitisation project is the result of the work carried out by Esther Pocock and 
                           Francisco Ferrer, students of the Master's Programme: Library and Information Science, Digital Library
                           and Information Services, from the University of Borås, Sweden.
                           The original book was lent by the library of Chalmers University in Gothenburg, Sweden. 
                           The main aim of this project was to preserve the content of the original source, 
                           as it is the only known copy in existence. This can be seen as a pilot study, more chapters 
                           could be added subsequently, allowing the whole book to be fully digitised eventually.<br> </strong>

                        <h3>About the book</h3>
                        <h5 class="justify-align">
                           <strong >There is only one known copy of this book in existence,
                              which in itself makes it a candidate for preservation on 
                              grounds of rarity. The book is part of the “Chalmeriana” 
                              special collection relating to the foundation and early years 
                              of Chalmers University in Gothenburg, so there is an 
                              argument that it has at least regional historical significance. 
                              The university was founded in 1829 using a legacy donation from
                              William Chalmers, a director of the Swedish East India Company, 
                              and was originally known as “Chalmersska Slöjdskolan” - a stamp 
                              which can be seen in the front of the book. Inspired by his fellow 
                              Freemason Pehr Dubb, then director of the then newly-opened Sahlgrenska 
                              Hospital, Chalmers left his entire fortune to the hospital and to the 
                              foundation of the school. The book dimetions are 128x11x2 cm.<br>

                           <strong >The book’s author Count Polykarpus Erik Cronhielm af
                              Hakunge was born in January 30th 1797 and dies in April 20th 1847.
                              He was a major in the Swedish army and had been made Commissioner 
                              of the Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences (Kungl Krigsvetenskapsakademien) 
                              in 1831 not long before the book was published, so clearly a person of some eminence. 
                              The Academy was founded in 1796 and still exists today. He was also the Governor 
                              in Stora  Kopparberg County.<br>
